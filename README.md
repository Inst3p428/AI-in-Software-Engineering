# 🤖 AI in Software Engineering

This project explores how AI can enhance software engineering through code generation, automated testing, bug prediction, and fairness analysis.

## 💡 Overview

We demonstrate how AI tools like GitHub Copilot, Hugging Face Transformers, and Testim.io help speed up development, improve quality, and automate routine tasks.

## 📌 Key Components

### 1. Theoretical Insights
- Benefits and limits of AI-driven code tools (e.g., Copilot)
- Supervised vs. unsupervised learning for bug detection
- Importance of bias mitigation in personalized UX
- Case study: How AIOps improves software deployments

### 2. Practical Tasks
- **Code Completion**: Compared AI-generated vs. manual Python function for sorting dictionaries
- **Automated Testing**: Used AI-powered tools to test login functionality
- **Predictive Analytics**: Built a model using the breast cancer dataset to predict issue priority

### 3. Ethics & Innovation
- Reflection on dataset bias and AI fairness
- Proposal: AI tool to auto-generate software documentation using transformers
